# Batch Render Manager - User Feedback Fixes

## Issues Addressed

Based on user feedback, the following improvements have been made:

---

## Issue 1: GPU Detection Shows None (Single GPU Systems)

### Problem
On systems with only 1 GPU, the UI showed "No GPUs available" because the system was trying to reserve GPU 0 for Maya and use GPU 1+ for batch rendering.

### Solution
**Smart GPU Allocation:**
- **Single GPU systems (1 GPU)**: GPU 0 is now marked as "shared" and available for both Maya and batch rendering
- **Multi-GPU systems (2+ GPUs)**: GPU 0 reserved for Maya, GPU 1+ available for batch
- **No GPU systems**: Shows "CPU Rendering" option

### Changes Made
1. **System Detector** (`core/system_detector.py`):
   - Detects single vs multi-GPU systems
   - Adjusts reservation logic automatically
   - Adds fallback for no-GPU systems

2. **UI Display** (`ui/widgets/batch_render_widget.py`):
   - Shows clear status: "1 GPU (shared with Maya)"
   - GPU combo shows: "GPU 0: [Name] (24GB) (shared)"
   - Helpful tooltips explain GPU allocation

### How It Works Now

#### Single GPU System (Your Case)
```
System Info:
  GPUs: 1 GPU (shared with Maya)
  Available: GPU 0 (shared), 28 CPU threads

GPU Dropdown:
  ‚úì GPU 0: NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB) (shared)
```

#### Multi-GPU System
```
System Info:
  GPUs: 2 total (1 for batch)
  Available: 1 GPUs, 28 CPU threads

GPU Dropdown:
  ‚úì GPU 1: NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB)
  (GPU 0 reserved for Maya)
```

#### No GPU System
```
System Info:
  GPUs: No CUDA GPUs detected (CPU rendering only)
  Available: CPU only: 28 threads

GPU Dropdown:
  ‚úì CPU Rendering (No GPU)
```

## Issue 2: Render Setup vs Render Layers Confusion

### Problem
Documentation and UI were not clear that the system uses **Maya Render Setup** (the modern system), not legacy render layers.

### Solution
**Clarified Terminology Throughout:**

### Changes Made

1. **UI Labels** (`ui/widgets/batch_render_widget.py`):
   - Changed "Render Layers:" to "**Render Setup Layer:**"
   - Added tooltip: "Select layer from Maya Render Setup (not legacy render layers)"
   - Refresh button tooltip: "Refresh layers from Render Setup"

2. **Code Documentation** (`core/scene_preparation.py`):
   - Updated docstrings to explicitly mention "Render Setup"
   - Added comments explaining it uses Render Setup API
   - Filters only enabled/renderable layers

3. **User Messages**:
   - Success: "Found 3 layers from Render Setup"
   - Error: "No Render Setup layers found. Please create layers in Render Setup first."

### How It Works

The system uses `maya.app.renderSetup.model.renderSetup` API to get layers:

```python
# Gets layers from Render Setup (not legacy)
from utils.render_layers import get_all_layers

layers = get_all_layers()  # Returns Render Setup layers
```

**What You Need:**
1. Open **Render Setup** window in Maya (not legacy Render Layers)
2. Create render layers in Render Setup
3. Enable the layers you want to render
4. Refresh in Batch Render UI

---

## Issue 3: Render Method Confusion

### Problem
Users didn't understand what "mayapy Custom", "Render.exe", etc. meant or which one to use.

### Solution
**Comprehensive Method Explanation System:**

### Changes Made

1. **Clearer Names** (`ui/widgets/batch_render_widget.py`):
   - "Auto (with fallback)" ‚Üí "**Auto (Recommended)**"
   - "mayapy Custom (Priority 1)" ‚Üí "**Custom Script (Advanced)**"
   - "Render.exe (Priority 2)" ‚Üí "**Render.exe (Standard)**"
   - "mayapy Basic (Priority 3)" ‚Üí "**Basic Script (Fallback)**"

2. **Rich Tooltips**:
   Each method now has detailed tooltip on hover:
   
   ```
   Auto (Recommended)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Automatically chooses best method with fallback
   ‚îú‚îÄ Tries: Custom Script ‚Üí Render.exe ‚Üí Basic Script
   ‚îî‚îÄ ‚úì Most reliable, handles failures automatically
   ```

3. **Help Button**:
   Added "?" button next to method dropdown that shows detailed help dialog with:
   - What each method does
   - How it works
   - When to use it
   - Pros and cons
   - Quick guide table

### Method Explanation

#### üåü Auto (Recommended)
**What it does:** Automatically selects best method and falls back if it fails.

**How it works:**
1. Tries Custom Script first (most flexible)
2. Falls back to Render.exe if custom fails (most reliable)
3. Falls back to Basic Script as last resort

**When to use:** Always use this unless you have specific needs!

**Pros:** Handles failures automatically, most reliable

---

#### üîß Custom Script (Advanced)
**What it does:** Runs mayapy with custom Python script for maximum control.

**How it works:** Creates Python script that:
- Opens your scene
- Sets up render settings
- Renders each frame individually
- Allows custom pre/post operations

**When to use:** When you need custom operations or complex pipeline integration.

**Pros:** Most flexible, allows custom operations  
**Cons:** Requires mayapy, slightly slower

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Render.exe (Standard)
**What it does:** Uses Maya's native batch renderer.

**How it works:** Calls Maya's built-in batch render command directly.

**When to use:** For standard rendering workflows without custom operations.

**Pros:** Most reliable, battle-tested, handles edge cases  
**Cons:** Less flexible, no custom operations

---

#### üì¶ Basic Script (Fallback)
**What it does:** Simple mayapy script with basic batch render command.

**How it works:** Opens scene and calls Maya's batchRender() command.

**When to use:** Only as last resort when other methods fail.

**Pros:** Simple, lightweight  
**Cons:** Limited functionality, least reliable

---

### Quick Guide

| Your Situation | Recommended Method |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Normal rendering | **Auto** (let system decide) |
| Need custom operations | **Custom Script** |
| Standard workflow | **Render.exe** |
| Troubleshooting | Try each method manually |

## Testing the Fixes

### Test GPU Detection
1. Open Batch Render tab
2. Check "System Information" section
3. Should show: "1 GPU (shared with Maya)"
4. GPU dropdown should show: "GPU 0: [Your GPU] (shared)"

### Test Render Setup
1. Open Maya Render Setup window
2. Create a test layer
3. In Batch Render tab, click "Refresh"
4. Should see your layer in dropdown
5. Tooltip should mention "Render Setup"

### Test Method Help
1. Look at "Render Method" dropdown
2. Hover over each option - should see detailed tooltip
3. Click "?" button - should see help dialog
4. Should clearly understand which method to use

---

## User Recommendations

### For Normal Use
1. **GPU**: Use default (GPU 0 on single GPU systems)
2. **Method**: Use "Auto (Recommended)"
3. **Render Setup**: Create layers in Render Setup window
4. **Frames**: Use simple syntax like "1-24"

### For Advanced Use
1. **Custom Operations**: Use "Custom Script (Advanced)"
2. **Multiple GPUs**: System automatically uses GPU 1+
3. **Complex Frames**: Use steps like "1-100x5"
4. **Troubleshooting**: Try methods manually if Auto fails

---

## Additional Notes

### GPU Sharing on Single GPU Systems
When using GPU 0 for both Maya and batch rendering:
- Maya GUI may slow down during batch render
- This is normal and expected
- Consider upgrading to multi-GPU system for better performance

### Render Setup Requirements
- Must use Maya Render Setup (not legacy render layers)
- Layers must be enabled/renderable
- System only shows enabled layers in dropdown

### Method Selection
- "Auto" is recommended for 99% of use cases
- Only use specific methods if you know why you need them
- Help dialog provides detailed guidance
